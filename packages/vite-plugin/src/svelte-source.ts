/**
 * `data-reticle-source` for `.svelte` single-file components.
 *
 * A SvelteKit app onboards, connects, and gets DOM, network, console, routing and storage — and then
 * every verdict comes back without the `file:line` the whole product leads with, because the JSX
 * stamper is Babel and a `.svelte` file is not JavaScript. This is the Svelte half.
 *
 * ## Where in the pipeline
 *
 * A Vite `transform` on the RAW component source, in the Reticle plugin, which already declares
 * `enforce: 'pre'` — so it runs before `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` and hands the compiler markup
 * that already carries the attribute. Getting the order wrong is the failure mode worth naming: run
 * it after, and there is no markup left to stamp, only generated JavaScript whose original line
 * numbers are gone. A Svelte *preprocessor* would also work and would be equally correct, but it has
 * to be wired into `svelte.config.js` by the user, and an integration nobody enables is an
 * integration that does not exist.
 *
 * ## Why the compiler is loaded the way it is
 *
 * `svelte` must never become a dependency of this package: a React project installing the Vite
 * plugin must not acquire a Svelte compiler, and its build must be unaffected. So the compiler is
 * resolved lazily, from the APP's directory, only when a `.svelte` id actually arrives, and its
 * absence returns null rather than throwing. Same shape as the optional `playwright` import in the
 * server's pool launcher.
 *
 * Resolution is synchronous (`createRequire`) rather than `await import()` because Svelte ships a CJS
 * build of its compiler and the plugin's `transform` is synchronous — making the whole hook async to
 * fetch an optional dependency would change the contract of every other path through it.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * The attribute only. Mapping a DOM node to the COMPONENT that rendered it — what `@reticlehq/react`
 * does through the fiber tree — is a separate and much larger problem, and is not attempted here.
